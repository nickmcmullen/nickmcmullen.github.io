I oversee and administer our companywide quarterly incentive program and other variable pay plans, with the overarching goal of improving, streamlining, and governing a wide variety of sales and executive incentive plans. I also work closely with our business intelligence and human resources teams to move & manipulate data, then glean insights from it to drive company performance.

## Education

I graduated _magna cum laude_ in May 2018 from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Academic Honor Society.

I also was a 4 year starter and 2 year captain for the Macalester Scots baseball team. I utilize the mental toughness developed during my time as an athlete to approach my work with grit and purpose every day.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking, trying new restaurants, attending local sporting events, exploring Phoenix area, and playing baseball.
