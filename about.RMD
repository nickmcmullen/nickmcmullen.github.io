## Education

I graduated _magna cum laude_ in May 2018 from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Academic Honor Society.

I also was a 4 year starter and 2 year captain for the Macalester Scots baseball team. I utilize the mental toughness developed during my time as an athlete to approach my work with grit and purpose every day.
