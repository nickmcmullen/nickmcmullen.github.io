I am currently a 4th year student at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA. I will be graduating in May 2018 with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking, trying new restaurants, going out for ice cream, and playing baseball.
