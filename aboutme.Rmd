\

Public service is something that I was raised on and around. Since my parents moved to Arizona nearly 30 years ago they have worked in public service, my father in state law enforcement and my mother in various state and local government entities.

\

Taking from their example, I've spent time in public service by: 

- Serving on the Payson Area Advisory Youth Council (youth town council)

- Acting as an officer on my college's Student Athlete Advisory Council

- Writing curriculum and teaching 7th grade math and high school business over the course of two summers 

- Most recently, in January of 2020 joining Dr. Scott Smith and other DVUSD administration officials and teachers on the Certified Performance Pay Committee. 

\

Now, I'm ready to step into a larger role and collaborate with the great minds in our community to help guide DVUSD forward for the betterment of all students and families.
