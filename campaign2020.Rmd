I am running for a seat on the **Governing Board** of the **Deer Valley Unified School District** during the 2020 election cycle. 

\

My campaign is simple and straightforward. The top priority is to **make decisions that are best for the kids** in the district. I'm not here to push a personal or political agenda. I believe if members on a school governing board can **unite** around a singlular mission to make sound, practical decisions that will positively impact the kids in their district, anything is possible. 

\

I can bring a fresh perspective to the Governing Board and a renewed mission to focus on the big picture. I graduated from Payson Unified School District in Gila County in 2014 and am only 6 years removed from the Arizona K-12 public education system myself. I, more than any other candidate, know exactly what it's like to walk in most of these kids' shoes. 

\

In summary, I am running for DVUSD Governing Board for these three reasons:

1. To make sound, practical decisions that positively affect students and their families

2. To act in service to our community by adding diversity of opinion and experience to conversations on school policy

3. To live the district's vision statment and inspire students to do the same, "Graduating lifelong learners who will successfully compete, lead, and positively impact the world."
