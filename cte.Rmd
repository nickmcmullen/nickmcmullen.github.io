Career & Technical Education (CTE) programs are not just for students planning to enter the workforce directly after high school anymore, they give all participating students **tangible, translatable skills for both college and career**. 

\

One of my goals is for DVUSD to be the leader in graduating college and career ready students in Arizona, which will create credibility for the district and confidence with families that when their child leaves DVUSD they are truly ready for the next step. As a former member of a high school DECA chapter, I understand that CTE programs play an essential role in giving students the necessary skills to achieve at the highest level after graduation, whether they go to college or directly into the workforce. 

\ 

To me, these programs are not "extra", they are a key part of creating well-rounded students that **align with the district's vision for graduates to compete, lead, and positively impact the world**. That is why I would push to ensure these critical programs retaine the necessary funding to continue full operation and explore integrating student participation in these programs into the district's broader strategic initiatives and evaluation processes.

For more information on how diverse and beneficial these programs are and why they are so important to me, please visit the [AZ Department of Education CTE Website](https://www.azed.gov/cte/).
