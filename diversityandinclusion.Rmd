Diversity of opinion, background, and heritage make us all unique and allow for richer conversations that can improve the lives of everyone around us. This needs to be celebrated and lifted up in our everyday discourse as a district.

I support a **zero-tolerance** policy toward actions, regulations, or other means that discriminate, disadvantage, or suppress any member of our district or community.
