I am a lifelong proponent of gifted education programs because they allow students at advanced levels to continue to learn, grow, and remain interested in school where mainstream curriculum may not be engaging enough. The academic rigor embraced by gifted programs prepare students to be critical-thinking, well-rounded humans that contribute to productive, civil discourse on their college campuses and in their communities.

A robust Gifted Services department at DVUSD is a key supporting factor of my long-term vision for the district to lead the state in student achievement and college/career preparation. I will be a staunch supporter of continued investment and growth in the department.
