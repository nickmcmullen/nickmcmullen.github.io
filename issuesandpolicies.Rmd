**Vision**

My vision for the district is simple and mostly aligns with the district's 5 year strategic plan, adopted in 2018.

In 5-10 years I would like to be able to say that DVUSD is the state's undisputed leader in:

- Student achievement in alignment with the State Board of Education's School Accountability Plan

- Faculty & Staff retention and satisfaction

- College and career preparation

\

**Guiding Philosophy**

- Make decisions that **positively affect ALL students** in the district

- Provide **oversight and vision** to the district, **not micromanagement**

- Thoroughly **prepare all students to confidently take the next step** into college or career 

- **Empower** our educators to take increased ownership over the direction of the district

- Separate politics from board activity and **unite** around the singular mission to do right by students

\ 

To me, this philosophy represents a common sense approach to ensuring our district, students, faculty and staff **thrive** for many years to come. That is why my campaign slogan is *Common Sense for Kids*
