The mental health of our students needs to be taken seriously. I support full, open discussions around broad mental health issues in our schools and adherance to all privacy laws regarding individual mental health situations.

If elected, I would collaborate with our administration to perform a full review of the mental health support and infrastructure in place at DVUSD, including resource availability on a school-by-school basis, and request recommendations from leadership on how to improve access for our students.
