The mental health of everyone in our district needs to be taken seriously. I support conversations in our schools designed to destigmatize mental health issues while expecting full adherance to all privacy laws related to individual mental health situations.

If elected, I would collaborate with our administration to perform a full review of the mental health support and infrastructure in place at DVUSD, including resource availability on a school-by-school basis, and request recommendations from leadership on how to improve access for our students, faculty, and staff.
