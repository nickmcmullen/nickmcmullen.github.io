A robust special education program is essential to a district's ability to provide every child their right to a high-quality, free public education. We have a responsibility to advocate for those that are unable to do so themselves.

I support DVUSD's current Special Education platform and philosophy of delivering these services in a Least Restrictive Environment (LSE). I would continue to advocate for improvements and program needs evaluations on a regular basis to ensure we are meeting the needs of our students and their families.
